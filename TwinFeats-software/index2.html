                        Twin brothers kent & Kevin Smotherman founded Twinfeats Software in 1983 with a simple premise:
                        Free software for a free world. From the beginings on the Commodore 64 to today's Android apps,
                        vision has never wavered.

<p>
       TwinFeats Software creates innovative, custom web applications which will meet
       and exceed expectations. We will work with you to fully understand your needs, but more than that - your data. Web
       applications are all about data, and witho u deeply understanding the needs of your data, your web 
       application will suffer.  
</p>
<h2> Web application? Huh?</h2>
<p>
        Web sites are static. The content they display doesnt change dynamically. A web application is a web site powered
        by a database. Facebook is a great example of a web application - the data shown varies by user
        and can change every single second.
