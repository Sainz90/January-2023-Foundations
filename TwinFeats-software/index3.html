            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p>
                Twin brothers Kent & Kevin Smotherman founded Twinfeats Software in 1983 with a simple premise: Free software for a free world. From the beginnings on the Commodore 64 to today's Android apps, their vision has never wavered.

                    Kent Smotherman has 38 years of professional development experience using over a dozen programming languages.
                    He enjoys teaching web development, chess, and petting the family cat, Solo (obviously), though he is not a bond villain.

                TwinFeats Software creates innovative, custom web applications which will meet and exceed expectations.
                We will work with you to fully understand your needs, but more than that - your data. 
                Web applications are all about data, and without deeply understanding the needs of your data, 
                your web application will suffer.
            </p>
            <h2>Web application? Huh?</h2>
            <p>
                Web sites are static. The content they display doesn't change dynamically. 
                A web application is a web site powered by a database.
